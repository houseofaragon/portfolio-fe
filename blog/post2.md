# **npm vs Yarn: What Are the Differences?**

When working with JavaScript and Node.js projects, you’ll often need a package manager to handle dependencies. The two most popular options are **npm** (Node Package Manager) and **Yarn**. Both are powerful tools, but they have key differences that might influence which one you choose.

---

## **1. What Are npm and Yarn?**
- **npm**: The default package manager for Node.js, introduced in 2010. It comes bundled with Node.js installations.
- **Yarn**: A package manager created by Facebook in 2016 to address some of npm's shortcomings at the time, such as speed and security.

---

## **2. Key Differences**

### **a. Speed**
- **npm**:
  - Historically slower due to a less optimized installation process.
  - With the release of npm 5 and beyond, performance improved significantly by introducing caching and parallelism.
- **Yarn**:
  - Faster in many scenarios, thanks to parallel downloads and a more efficient caching mechanism.

### **b. Package Locking**
- **npm**:
  - Uses a `package-lock.json` file to lock dependency versions and ensure consistent installs across environments.
  - Introduced deterministic dependency resolution starting with npm 5.
- **Yarn**:
  - Uses a `yarn.lock` file, which was one of its standout features when it launched.
  - Ensures consistent dependency trees and faster installs by leveraging the lock file.

### **c. Security**
- **npm**:
  - Introduced security auditing tools in npm 6 with the `npm audit` command, allowing developers to check for vulnerabilities.
- **Yarn**:
  - Uses checksums to verify the integrity of packages during installation, adding an extra layer of security.
  - Yarn's focus on security was one of its key advantages at launch.

### **d. Offline Capabilities**
- **npm**:
  - Introduced offline caching in later versions, but it’s not as seamless as Yarn’s implementation.
- **Yarn**:
  - Offers robust offline caching by default. Once a package is installed, it can be reused without an internet connection.

### **e. Commands**
While npm and Yarn share similar functionality, their commands can differ slightly.

| Task                      | npm Command             | Yarn Command          |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Install dependencies      | `npm install`          | `yarn`               |
| Add a package             | `npm install package`  | `yarn add package`   |
| Remove a package          | `npm uninstall package`| `yarn remove package`|
| Install dev dependency    | `npm install package --save-dev` | `yarn add package --dev` |
| Update a package          | `npm update package`   | `yarn upgrade package` |
| Audit for vulnerabilities | `npm audit`            | `yarn audit`         |

### **f. Monorepo Support**
- **npm**:
  - Supports monorepos using third-party tools like `lerna`.
- **Yarn**:
  - Comes with built-in support for monorepos via **Yarn Workspaces**, simplifying project management.

### **g. Community and Ecosystem**
- **npm**:
  - As the default Node.js package manager, it has a larger user base and ecosystem.
  - Backed by the Node.js Foundation.
- **Yarn**:
  - Popular among larger teams and projects, especially those that adopted it early for its performance and security benefits.


## **3. Which One Should You Use?**
### **Use npm if**:
- You’re comfortable with its default features and commands.
- You prefer the simplicity of using the package manager bundled with Node.js.

### **Use Yarn if**:
- You need better offline support or workspace management.
- You value faster installations and improved security checks.


## **4. Conclusion**
Both npm and Yarn have evolved significantly over the years, and the choice between them often comes down to personal or team preference. For most modern projects, either tool will serve you well. However, if you’re starting a new project, it’s worth evaluating both to see which aligns better with your workflow.
