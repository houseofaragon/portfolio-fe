                At work I have written primarily in Node, React, and PHP -- this was the stack of choice.

                Presented here are my own personal projects. This is only a miniscule view into what I've working on between hours. In this space I've been able to experient in wider range of technologies - which include ThreeJS, D3, Vue, Nuxt, Next, Python, more Node and more React.
